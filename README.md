# To-Do-list-application-using-smart-contracts
Question : 
“We want to create a decentralized To Do application that allows users to store simple notes
of no more than 32 letters. Each note must contain the date it was created, the address of the
owner and if it’s already completed or not. Any user will be able to create notes but only the
owner of each note will be able to mark them as completed.”

from the textbook "Ethereum Developer: Learn Solidity From Scratch" by Merunas Grincalaitis.
